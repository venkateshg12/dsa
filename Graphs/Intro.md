Directed Graph ----> having arrows (direction).
Undirected Graph ----> no arrows (no direction).
Path ----> contain a lot of nodes and each of them are reachable.
degrees in graph ----> number of edges attached to a node.
total degree of a graph == 2 * no of edges (E).
For directed graph..
indegree (no of incoming edges).
outdegree (no of outgoing edges).
